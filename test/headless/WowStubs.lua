  Opt-in registry of WoW-global stubs.

  This is deliberately NOT a full Blizzard API mock. A spec requires this module and pulls only the
  stubs it needs, installs them onto the global table for the duration of the test, then restores
  the previous values so nothing leaks across specs. The Bootstrap helper prepends test/headless to
  package.path so this resolves as `require("WowStubs")`.

  Usage:
    local wowStubs = require("WowStubs")

    local restore
    before_each(function()
      restore = wowStubs.install({ SomeApi = function() return 42 end })
    end)
    after_each(function() restore() end)
]]--

  Install a table of name -> value stubs onto the global table.

  @param {table} stubs
    map of global name to stub value (function, table, ...)

  @return {function}
    a restore function that puts the previous global values back (including nil for globals that
    did not previously exist). Call it from after_each.
]]--
function M.install(stubs)
  local previous = {}
  local names = {}

  for name, value in pairs(stubs) do
    previous[name] = _G[name]
    names[#names + 1] = name
    _G[name] = value
  end

  return function()
    for _, name in ipairs(names) do
      _G[name] = previous[name]
    end
  end

  Ready-made stub builders for the WoW globals the specs touch. The Cmd spec installs its WoW
  globals (SlashCmdList, ReloadUI, DEFAULT_CHAT_FRAME, ...) ad hoc via install(). Add shared
  builders here as new specs need them.

  GetAddOnMetadata(addonName, key) -> string (the legacy global the localization files call for
